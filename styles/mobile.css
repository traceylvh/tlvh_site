/* July 28, 2016 was an amazing day. I was offered what is (possibly) my dream
job, and I accepted. Had a conversation with my spouse about the messiness of life,
the pain of the past, the acceptance of Now and hope for things to come.

Cathartic cry, much needed.

Life is messy and good and it is mine. */
